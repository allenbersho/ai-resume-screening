# AI Resume Screening

AI Resume Screening is an intelligent system that automates the process of screening job applicants’ resumes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The project helps recruiters and HR teams efficiently shortlist candidates by matching resumes against job descriptions and ranking them based on relevance.

## 📌 Project Overview

In traditional hiring processes, recruiters manually screen hundreds of resumes, which is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to reduce that effort by using AI techniques to automatically analyze resumes and identify the most suitable candidates.

The system extracts text from resumes, processes it using NLP techniques, compares it with job descriptions, and produces similarity scores to rank candidates effectively.
